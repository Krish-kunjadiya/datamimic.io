## ‚ú® Features

DataMimic.io is built around two powerful, user-friendly modules:

### 1. üìä Synthetic Data Generation

Unleash your creativity and generate bespoke datasets tailored to your exact specifications.

* **Customizable Dataset Parameters:**
    * **Number of Records:** Define the exact size of your dataset (e.g., 100, 10,000 rows).
    * **Missing Value Percentage:** Introduce realistic data imperfections by controlling the percentage of missing values.
    * **Feature Covariance/Correlation:** Influence statistical relationships between numerical features for more authentic data.
* **Geographical Locality:** Generate locale-specific data (names, addresses, currencies) for regions like India, UK, US, Canada, and Australia.
* **Flexible Schema Definition:**
    * **Pre-defined Industry Schemas:** Kickstart your dataset creation with templates for:
        * ‚öïÔ∏è **Medical:** Patient_ID, Name, Age, Gender, Contact, Symptom_1, Symptom_2, Diagnosis, Medications, DoctorVisit_Date, Follow_Up
        * üí∞ **Finance:** Transaction_ID, Name, Amount, Transaction_Type, Account_Number, Bank_Name, Transaction_Date
        * üõçÔ∏è **Retail:** Order_ID, Customer_Name, Product, Quantity, Price, Payment_Method, Order_Date
        * üéì **Education:** Student_ID, Name, Age, Gender, Course, Year, Grade, GPA, University, Graduation_Year
        * üöó **Automotive:** Vehicle_ID, Owner_Name, Make, Model, Year, License_Plate, Mileage, Fuel_Type, Service_Date, Next_Service_Due
    * **Custom Column Definition:** Add your own columns with specified names, descriptions, and data types (Integer, Float, String, Boolean, Date, Email, Phone, Full Name, Address, City, Country, Zip, Categorical).
* **Multi-Format Download:** Download your generated datasets in popular formats: CSV, Excel (XLSX), and JSON.

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è No-Code EDA & Pre-processing

Upload your existing CSV or Excel files and effortlessly clean, transform, and analyze them without writing a single line of code.

* **Effortless File Upload:** Simple drag-and-drop or file selection for `.csv` and `.xlsx` files.
* **Comprehensive Data Overview (EDA):** Get instant insights into your dataset with:
    * General statistics (rows, columns, file size).
    * Column-wise details (data types, non-null counts, missing value percentages, unique values).
    * Descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, std dev, min, max, quartiles).
    * Frequency counts for categorical columns.
    * *(Future: Basic visualizations like histograms, bar charts, correlation heatmaps)*
* **Powerful Data Pre-processing Operations:**
    * **Missing Value Handling:**
        * Remove rows or columns with missing values.
        * Impute missing numerical values (mean, median, mode).
        * Impute missing categorical values (mode).
    * **Duplicate Handling:** Remove exact duplicate rows.
    * **Column Management:** Easily remove specific columns.
    * **Data Type Conversion:** Change column data types (e.g., Numeric to String, String to Date).
    * **Data Scaling & Normalization:** Apply Min-Max Scaling or Standardization (Z-score Normalization) to numerical columns.
    * **Text Cleaning:** Repair inconsistent capitalization (convert to UPPERCASE, Camel Case, or lowercase).

## üíª Technology Stack

DataMimic.io leverages robust and widely-used technologies to ensure performance and reliability:

### Backend:

* **Python:** The core language for all data generation and processing logic.
* **Flask:** A lightweight and flexible Python web framework for building the API endpoints that power the application.
* **Pandas:** Essential for high-performance data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
* **Scikit-learn:** Utilized for various data pre-processing and potentially synthetic data generation techniques.

### Frontend:

* modern JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS for a rich.

## üöÄ Getting Started 

To run DataMimic.io locally, you would typically follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/datamimic.io.git](https://github.com/your-username/datamimic.io.git)
    cd datamimic.io
    ```
2.  **Set up a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(A `requirements.txt` file would list Flask, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)*
4.  **Run the Flask backend:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
5.  **Set up and run the frontend:** *(This would depend on the chosen frontend technology, e.g., `npm install` and `npm start` for a React app.)*
